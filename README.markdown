#This repo is meant to hold some of the helper functions that I use on a daily/weekly basis while developing ASP.NET MVC projects.

## This solution includes but is not limited to:
1. HtmlHelper.Script() - Renders a <script type="text/javascript" /> element
2. HtmlHelper.StyleSheet() - Renders a <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />  element
