#This repo is meant to hold some of the helper functions that I use on a daily/weekly basis while developing ASP.NET MVC projects.

## This solution includes but is not limited to:
1. HtmlHelper.Script() - Renders a &lt;script type="text/javascript" /&gt; element
2. HtmlHelper.StyleSheet() - Renders a &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;  element
